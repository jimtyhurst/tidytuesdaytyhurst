## TODO

* Read `salary_potential` data.
* Combine `salary_potential` and `tuition_cost` into a single `tbl`.
* Can the `salary_potential` variables `mid_career_pay` and `make_world_better_percent` be predicted from `tuition_cost` variables, such as `type`, `in_state_total`, and `out_of_state_total`?
* Is `salary_potential$stem_percent` correlated with public vs private `type` of school?


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Install the needed packages

```{r}
#install.packages("remotes")
#remotes::install_github("thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR")

# Optional package for browsing:
#remotes::install_github("laderast/burro")
```

## Look at the available datasets

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
# This will open up in the help window:
#tidytuesdayR::tt_available()
```

## Load the dataset

Load your dataset in with the function below. The input is the date the dataset was issued. You should be able to get this from the `tt_available()` function.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Incoming data comes in as a list
datasets <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-03-10')
# Show the names of the individual datasets
names(datasets)
df <- datasets$tuition_cost
```

To explore the data quickly, use [burro](https://github.com/laderast/burro), which opens a web app for browsing the data:

```{r}
library(burro)
library(ggplot2)
burro::explore_data(df,outcome_var = NULL)
```

```{r}
dim(df)
```

```{r}
colnames(df)
```

```{r}
head(df$name)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  dplyr::select(state, state_code, type) %>% 
  head()
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    in_state_tuition, 
    in_state_total, 
    out_of_state_tuition, 
    out_of_state_total
  ) %>% 
  head()
```
